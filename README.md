Acoustic contrast control is a key methodology for
generating personal sound zones, and its application in stable
acoustic environments has been extensively studied. However, in
real-world scenarios, changes in the acoustic environment are
inevitable. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
adaptive control method capable of online modeling of the acous-
tic transfer functions in non-stationary environments. A data-
block-based frequency domain adaptive algorithm is employed
for acoustic transfer functions modeling, while a power-based
eigenvector tracking algorithm is used for updating the control
filters. Simulations were conducted using publicly available im-
pulse response data to evaluate the performance of a six-speaker
array across two sound zones. The results demonstrate that
the proposed method effectively tracks environmental changes
and adapts the control filters, ensuring stable acoustic contrast
performance
